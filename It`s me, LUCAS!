- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucsSM
- 👀 I’m a curious person that is trying to learn Programming. Still quite lost and confused but at the moment, i`m leaning towards JAVA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA (trying, at least).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me though this learning process, :)
- 📫 For the moment, message me here. I`ll try to open more channels as I get used to Programming and get confident to really explore this quite complex universe...
